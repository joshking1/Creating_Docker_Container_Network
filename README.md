# Creating_Docker_Container_Network

In docker, we can create a network and connect container/s to the created network. 

The connected containers will communicate with the host where the docker is deployed. 

The communication will take place by using their IP address of each other.

A container can connect to one or more networks in that docker host.

The bridge is the default network of docker.
